Description: 
With the conquest of the entire Italian peninsula behind it, the invincible Roman Republic reaches its peak. As a Roman citizen, you live in Rome, the capital of the 
Roman Republic. As you travel along this journey, every decision you make will have an impact on the course of your life. From merchant to gladiator, you can become 
anything based on the decisions you make.


Paths:


1. Choosing to be a merchant:


In the midst of wealth and luxury, you are a successful merchant. A journey across the Mediterranean, a trading enterprise, and a fortune to be made. In the course of 
trading with a barbarian soldier, you become involved in an altercation with him because he refuses to pay for the goods you've traded for. In order to avenge 
yourself, you decide to use the wealth you have.




2. Choosing to be a soldier in the Roman army:


With a long history of service in the Roman army, you have demonstrated your patriotism. As a result of your many victories, you have earned the respect of your 
fellow soldiers and accumulated a great deal of wealth for your family. Upon serving for 30 years, you have to decide whether to retire and spend the rest of your 
life with family or continue serving the Roman Republic.


3. Choosing to be a gladiator:


As a gladiator, your only motto is "fight to survive.". In order to become a legend in the Colosseum, you must fight and win every battle. Besides earning a fortune, 
your fighting abilities have earned you respect from the authority. In spite of this, you must decide whether to live as a civilian or die in the sands as a gladiator.
